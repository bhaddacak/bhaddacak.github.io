Eugene Watson Burlingame translated the commentary to Dhammapada as *Buddhist Legends* (1921, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press). It has 3 volumes and available online in book form, Vols: [1](https://archive.org/details/buddhistlegends01burluoft), [2](https://archive.org/details/buddhistlegends02burluoft), [3](https://archive.org/details/buddhistlegends03burluoft). The books also have an OCR version, so I put the content here. The text has moderate quality and has not been fully edited. If some parts are not clear, please consult the books directly. For your information, Burlingame used Burmese edition of the Pāli, so the source text can be slightly different. And he translated only the story parts, not the commentaries which explain the Pāli verses. There are also discrepancies on story counting. In Burlingame's edition, XX.3 and XX.4 are part of the story no. 205, and XXVI.34 is part of the story no. 296. So, please rely on the overall story number, not the number in its section, particularly in Book XX and XXVI.
