The application can run in Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux. For more information, see the user's manual.

	Suitable for GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows, the package has no JRE. Windows users who plan to use other JRE (64-bit) should load this, then unpack your JRE, rename its folder to `jre` and move it to the program's root directory.

3. [Sentences](https://github.com/bhaddacak/pp2-sentences){:target="\_blank"} <svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/fontawesome/custom.svg#github-alt"></use></svg>

	This backup data of the bundled sentences can help the users restore the original sentences in case they mess up with the existing ones.
