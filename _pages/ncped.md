This *New Concise Pali-English Dictionary* is compiled by [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net) from Buddhadatta's *Concise Pali-English Dictionary*, updated and corrected from Margaret Cone's *Dictionary of Pali*, then slightly modified by J.R. Bhaddacak (i.e. converting ṁ to ṃ, partitioning, and some editing). Only an asterisk (\*) at the start can be used as a wildcard.
