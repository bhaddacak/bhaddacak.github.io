This application is deliberately written to be a powerful learning and research tool on Pāli language. My ambitious goal is to make the most enjoyable Pāli tool indispensable to the language learning. However, as the thing has been developed so far, it is now difficult to add new functionality without forsaking the old code. So, the application is now split into two codebases.

## Pāli Platform Classic

This is the updated version of `Pāli Platform 2`. The content of the program is mostly retained, except some enhancement in `Document Finder` and several minor additions and fixes. The main purpose of this codebase is to preserve what has been done so far (before drastic changes are made). This branch of the program will not be developed further, except serious bug fixes, so its main version will stay with `2`. Also now the source code is fully opened under GPL3.

## Pāli Platform (New Generation)

After I have developed many tools in this website, I hope I can add them to `Pāli Platform` as well. By the fact that the program is heavily based on the CSCD data, adding new features without upsetting the old system becomes difficult. After I finished the [CST restructured](/cstpage), the need for the old collection is now less pressing. The main goal of the new `Pāli Platform` is therefore to move the focus to the new collection because of its better organization.

Furthermore, now the [DPD](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} (Digital Pāḷi Dictionary) makes its data easier accessed programmatically. So, the program can use this to enhance its functionalities. Last but not least, as we all know that the data from [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/){:target="\_blank"} are valuable. It will be beneficial to all learners if we can also have this in the program.
