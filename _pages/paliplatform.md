This application is deliberately written to be a powerful learning and research tool on Pāli language. My ambitious goal is to make the most enjoyable Pāli tool indispensable to the language learning.

On the course of development, the program had been split into two codebases: One is the retention of `Pāli Platform 2` known as `Pāli Platform Classic`. Now this codebase is discontinued and removed to reduce the maintaining cost. Another one is the preferable `Pāli Platform 3`, which is substantial improved in its recent release.

Now that [*Pāli Platform: The Official Manual*](/ppman){:target="\_blank"} has been available (but maybe not up-to-date), the full information about the program should be read from the manual.

At the start of 2026, `Pāli Platform 4` has been released with several enhancements and a direction toward Sanskrit learning. This also makes `Pāli Platform 3` deprecated, and its releases will be removed soon.

Some technical information including the download links, partly overlapping with the manual, can be seen here:
