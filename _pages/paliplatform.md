A comprehensive tool for P훮li studies, `P훮li Platform 2` is newly rewritten, with a new look, more features, and less bugs (hopefully). The old version is now discontinued and revoked its current license. The GPL3 license will be applied to the new version in the coming release.

The application can run in Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux. For more information, see the user's manual in the package.
