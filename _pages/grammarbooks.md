This part is a collection of Pāli grammatical textbooks. I select the important ones, put them here, and make them easy to access and navigate. By the traditional account, there are three big schools of Pāli grammarians: Kaccāyana, Moggallāna, and Saddanīti. All these with their chief commentaries will be added here, together with other remarkable works.

I think studying these texts is not necessary to normal Buddhist practitioners, but they can be an intellectual challenge for those who have already done the basic things and need to go deeper in the field. I do not think knowing deep grammar will bring you more or higher liberation. (Instead, it can hinder the progress because it needs lots of time and effort.) However, for scholarly-minded learners, studying Pāli language in depth can make the time worthwhile, and it contributes to the field of Buddhist Studies at large.

Western students may find these works difficult, because it is hard to get full translations of these in their languages. This tells us that serious studies of the traditional Pāli textbooks in the West are really pressing. Perhaps, learning them with a help from living languages like Thai or Myanmar is more viable.

### 1. Kaccāyanabyākaraṇaṃ

> The grammar book by Kaccāyana is the oldest. But how old is a matter of dispute. To the traditional mind, the author was the Venerable Mahākaccāyana comtemporary to the Buddha. It is really unlikely if we consider seriously the language used at that time. The book was probably composed in Sri Lanka by using a Sanskrit grammatical model (after *Kātantra*, to be precise), maybe after the era of commentaries but before that of subcommentaries.[^norman-kacc]
>
> The Kaccāyana has a number of commentaries or rearranged works. The most important is *Padarūpasiddhi* or *Rūpasiddhi* written by Buddhappiya Dīpaṅkara around the second half of the 13th century. When Pāli students study Kaccāyana, Rūpasiddhi is normally brought together to gain more understanding. As we can see that most of the Kaccāyana suttas have their corresponding Rūpasiddhi sutta. So, I put them together here.

[^norman-kacc]: K. R. Norman believes that this Kaccāyana must be later than Buddhaghosa because the name was not mentioned in the commentaries. See K. R. Norman, 1983, *Pāli Literature*,  Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, p. 163.

### 2. Moggallānabyākaraṇaṃ

> The second big school is of Moggallāna. The work was written in the early 12th century. It often has different views from Kaccāyana. As noted by K. R. Norman, "Moggallāna deals with the linguistic material more exhaustively and with greater understanding of the essence and character of Pali."[^norman-mogg] In general, the formulas of Moggallāna's suttas are terse and more difficult to decipher.
>
> Moggallāna wrote his own commentary known as *Moggallānapañcikā*. This work is somewhat difficult to follow. A more popular commentary on Moggallāna is *Payogasiddhi* written by Medhaṅkara around the 13th century. Its status is like Rūpasiddhi to Kaccāyana. So, I put Moggallāna and Payogasiddhi together in the same manner. However, the Pañcikā is also included as the reader's option.
>
> Another recent important commentary in this school is Leḍī Sayāḍo's *Niruttidīpanī*, finished in 1903. With this work, we can link Moggallāna to Kaccāyana and Saddanīti suttas. This is really helpful to Pāli students and researchers for doing a comparative study.

### 3. Saddanītippakaraṇaṃ

> Saddanīti is a monumental work written by Aggavaṃsa in Myanmar around the 12th-13th century. This is the most comprehensive Pāli grammatical book ever produced. It has three parts: Padamālā, Dhātumālā, and Suttamālā. The last one is the most important and more widely known. Because, I think, it follows the traditional format with formulas and explanations laid down formerly by Pāṇini.
>
> I add Suttamālā first because it is somewhat needed and really hard to find in suitable digital format (not included in the CSCD). Other parts will be added later.
