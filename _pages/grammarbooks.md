This part is a collection of Pāli grammatical textbooks. I select the important ones, put them here, and make them easy to access and navigate. By the traditional account, there are three big schools of Pāli grammarians: Kaccāyana, Moggallāna, and Saddanīti. All these with their chief commentaries will be added here, together with other remarkable works.

I think studying these texts is not necessary to normal Buddhist practitioners, but they can be an intellectual challenge for those who have already done the basic things and need to go deeper in the field. I do not think knowing deep grammar will bring you more or higher liberation. (Instead, it can hinder the progress because it needs lots of time and effort.) However, for scholarly-minded learners, studying Pāli language in depth can make the time worthwhile, and it contributes to the field of Buddhist Studies at large.

Western students may find these works difficult, because it is hard to get full translations of these in their languages. This tells us that serious studies of the traditional Pāli textbooks in the West are really pressing. Perhaps, learning them with a help from living languages like Thai or Myanmar is more viable.

### 1. Saddanītippakaraṇaṃ

> Saddanīti is a monumental work written by Aggavaṃsa in Myanmar around the 12th-13th century. This is the most comprehensive Pāli grammatical book ever produced. It has three parts: Padamālā, Dhātumālā, and Suttamālā. The last one is the most important and more widely known. Because, I think, it follows the traditional format with formulas and explanations laid down formerly by Pāṇini.
>
> I add Suttamālā first because it is somewhat needed and really hard to find in suitable digital format (not included in the CSCD). Other parts will be added later. Text preparation takes hours of cleaning up plus days of programming, so new materials will probably be added up weekly.
