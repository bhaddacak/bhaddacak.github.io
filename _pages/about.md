**J.R. Bhaddacak** is (sort of) a scholar of Theravāda Buddhism and Pāli Language, yet a professional programmer (outside the industry). Mostly, he contents himself with serenity in seclusion.

This site is meant to be the official portal to his works and thoughts. The Jekyll theme used is modified from [`contrast`](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast){:target="\_blank"}. All online applications use JavaScript, so it must be enabled in the user's browser. Several of them use [`pako`](https://github.com/nodeca/pako){:target="\_blank"} to decompress downloaded materials.

The site's design and interface are intentionally kept **s**imple, **c**lean, **u**nintrusive, and mostly **v**anilla (SCUV). Using Firefox will give the user experiences as the author intend.

Trivial comments and suggestions can be posted at the [`Pāli Platform`](http://paliplatform.blogspot.com){:target="\_blank"} blog. For a more serious communication, please use this email address: `bhaddacak` at `proton` dot `me`. 

For personal expressions of the author, see [Bhaddacak's Memoir](https://bhaddacak.wordpress.com){:target="\_blank"}.

Since the Internet is a great enemy of the peaceful mind, the author lives offline life most of the time, and only connects to the world when necessary. The shortest period can be once in a week or weeks, but it can be as long as once in a month or even longer. So, the author apologizes to those who need a serious communication with him. If it is serious enough, it is always worth waiting for.
