## Introduction

Programming tasks are difficult and time consuming. When I cannot solve certain problems or I realize that there are many things to be done, I usually put my work aside and pick up other things to play with until I have the right kind of mood to go on. Recently my work on `PƒÅli Platform 3` has been decelerated for months because I have to think hard to redesign the program's structure. This often exhausts me.

Meanwhile I have been learning about photographing as a way of defocusing my work and making some fun. And here are the product of 2 months or so of this activity. My gear consists of cheap mobile phones and old digital SLR cameras with some lenses. These work fine for me. However, it is not about shooting alone because mostly the photos taken are manipulated somehow (at least, by cropping and color adjustment) using computer programs before being used. Tackling these programs is also a kind of fun to me.

Here are main programs used. For quick adjustments, I use `gThumb` and `Fotoxx` (now called `Fotocx`). For more refined manipulations, `GIMP` is the best. Sometimes I shoot in raw format, a little overkill for me, and use `LightZone` or simply `nUFRaw`, also but rarely `Darktable` and `RawTherapee`. For making panoramic images, `Hugin` is mostly used, sometimes also `Fotoxx` (which is better for some cases). All these show that we do not really need `Photoshop` for such workflow.

To make the photos usable, I make them as desktop wallpapers by 1920 x 1080 pixels (16:9). Many of photos are heavily manipulated.

## The standing Buddha

Now move to the subject, the standing Buddha is a statue located at the monastery near a mountain I live by now. In fact, it is not a beautiful or spectacular one. However, we have ways to make it look interesting. This is my most shot subject and I may have hundreds of its photos. So, I select some of them to show here.

### With the moon

Photographing the Buddha with the moon is a bit tricky because we hardly have enough light. It is also hard to make the right focus even a tripod is used. Moreover, without a good telephoto lens we cannot get the moon in relatively big enough size. The first photo and its derivatives is in a full moon day (the moon is enlarged by retouching), the others have a crescent (the Buddha also has a good smiling face). Because the Buddha statue is not in a good condition as shown in the real photo below, I have to use some effects to make it more interesting.

### Against the sky

When the sky is clear or has clouds, it is enough to make the Buddha look interesting like the following pictures.

### At dusk and dawn

For photographers, there are golden hours in each day, at sunrise and sunset, because only at this time we can get red color from the sky. However, the sky is not equally beautiful everyday. By the location of the Buddha, shooting pictures in the morning is usually better. The colors in the following images may look exaggerated because the Buddha is better made silhouette or low-key in such a scene.

### Against the mountain

I have made several panoramic pictures related to the standing Buddha. Since we have a limited view for desktop wallpapers, I just show a few of them here in cropped view.
