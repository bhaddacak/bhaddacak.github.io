This will be the last addition here in this period before I continue writing `Pāli Platform 3`, and it is the hardest of all I have been doing so far. Unlike students of Buddhism in the past who had difficulty in finding Pāli texts to read, today we have several versions of them easily accessible via the Internet. The most complete collection is of the *Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana Tipiṭaka* (CST), formerly known as [CSCD](https://www.tipitaka.org){:target="\_blank"} distributed by Vipassana Research Institute. This collection has been the main source of materials for many students of Buddhism and Pāli, including me.

A better edited collection recently is of [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net){:target="\_blank"}. Although this is not complete, it serves as a beginner-friendly source with a good coverage of English translations. Because of the fragmented data in this site plus its idiosyncracy, albeit well-organized, it is difficult to work with in some situations.

Although the data of CST are reliable and good in many respects, the collection is not perfect. To programmers who make use of the data, several features are needed to be improved and many points are needed to be fixed so that we can make a better reader or search program. Moreover, to scholars, it should be an easier way to refer to the texts. This is a hard problem because referencing method depends heavily on the structure of the texts. Now the old days of PTS referring system have gone and several new systems arise. Here we will have another referencing system, which reflects the data we use.

That is to say, the target users of this collection are researchers and serious learners. So, we organize the texts in the way that related data are put together, able to be used at hand. And by the motto of this site, *"Buddhists should be able to read Pāli texts by themselves"*, we do not offer any translation here.

For more information about the structure of the collection, see [CST-Kit](https://github.com/bhaddacak/cst-kit){:target="\_blank"}.

## Vinayapiṭaka

At this beginning stage, available books are the main text in the Vinaya: Bhikkhuvibhaṅga 1 (Buv1), Bhikkhuvibhaṅga 2 (Buv2), Bhikkhunīvibhaņga (Biv), Mahāvagga (Mv), Cūḷavagga (Cv), and Parivāra (Pvr). The sole commentary of these is Samantapāsādikā (Sp) by Buddhaghosa, which is divided in the same manner, hence Sp1 to Sp6. And linkable exegeses of Sp are Sāratthadīpanī (Sd), its main commentary, Vajirabuddhi (Vjb), and Vimativinodanī (Vmv). All these have parallel structure to the main texts (there is no Vjb3 for Biv). If these documents are opened by chained opening using the toolbar, they can be synchronized at once, if the option is selected. To see the how it looks like, go [HERE](http://paliplatform.blogspot.com/2023/10/synchronization-of-cst-docs.html){:target="\_blank"}. Other texts with this structure can be used in the same manner.

The remaining texts will be added up weekly. The collection is supposed to be completed around the end of November.

## Guideline for text referencing

Texts in the collection can be accessed by URL, for example, to get to Bhikkhuvibhaṅga 1, you can go to [{{ site.url }}/cst?buv1](/cst?buv1){:target="\_blank"}. If a specific paragraph number is given, it can directly jump to that point, for example, [{{ site.url }}/cst?buv1=24](/cst?buv1=24){:target="\_blank"}.
