**J.R. Bhaddacak** is (sort of) a scholar of Theravāda Buddhism and Pāli Language, yet a professional programmer (outside the industry). Mostly, he contents himself with serenity in seclusion.

This site is meant to be the official portal to his works and thoughts. The theme used here is slightly modified from [`contrast`](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast).

The site's dark color scheme can be set by the browser's preferences, e.g., by *Website appearance* in Firefox.
