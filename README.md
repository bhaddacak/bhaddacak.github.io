**J.R. Bhaddacak** is (sort of) a scholar of Theravāda Buddhism and Pāli Language, yet a professional programmer (outside the industry). Mostly, he contents himself with serenity in seclusion.

This site is meant to be the official portal to his works and thoughts. The Jekyll theme used is modified from [`contrast`](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast){:target="_blank"}. All online applications use JavaScript, so it must be enabled in the user's browser. Several of them use [`pako`](https://github.com/nodeca/pako){:target="_blank"} to decompress downloaded materials.

The site's design and interface are intendedly kept **s**imple, **c**lean, **u**nintrusive, and mostly **v**anilla (SCUV). Using Firefox will give the user experiences as the author intend.

Trivial comments and suggestions can be posted at the [`Pāli Platform`](http://paliplatform.blogspot.com){:target="_blank"} blog. For a more serious communication, please use email (find the author's address in the books).
