**J.R. Bhaddacak** is (sort of) a scholar of Theravāda Buddhism and Pāli Language, yet a professional programmer (outside the industry). Mostly, he contents himself with serenity in seclusion.

This site is meant to be the official portal to his works and thoughts. The site utilizes a simple and elegant theme called [`contrast`](https://niklasbuschmann.github.io/contrast/).
