**J.R. Bhaddacak** is (sort of) a scholar of Theravāda Buddhism and Pāli Language, yet a professional programmer (outside the industry). Mostly, he contents himself with serenity in seclusion.

This site is meant to be the official portal to his works and thoughts. The theme used here is modified from [`contrast`](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast). Several online applications here use [`pako`](https://github.com/nodeca/pako) to decompress downloaded materials.

The site's design and interface are intentedly kept <strong>s</strong>imple, <strong>c</strong>lean, and <strong>u</strong>nintrusive (SCU).
